## Overview 

Hathora built Bullet Mania to showcase how simple it can be to build scalable multiplayer games with Hathora Cloud.

Adding Idem’s matchmaking to Bullet Mania shows how a full-fledged multiplayer game can be created, without the need of any server infrastructure.

In this solution, the players directly connect to Idem’s matchmaker. When a match is found, Idem spins up a game server on Hathora’s cloud, where the game is played. After the game is concluded, the results are returned to Idem in order to update the rating and ranking.
